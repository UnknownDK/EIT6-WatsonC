 *
 * \section LCD4   LCD EXAMPLE4 - TEXT DISPLAY TEST
 *
 * \subsection LCD4x    TEST DESCRIPTION:
 *      This test code demonstrates displaying a string of characters on the
 * LCD panel. Different text is displayed on the LCD panel in two steps.
 *
 * In the first step two character strings are displayed on the LCD panel
 * using DMA mode with text in White color. LCD panel is divided into two
 * vertical parts to display the strings in separate planes.
 * String "IMAGINATION IS BEGINNING OF CREATION.YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU DESIRE"
 * will be displayed on the left half of the LCD.
 * String "YOU WILL WHAT YOU IMAGINE AND AT LAST YOU CREATE WHAT YOU WILL"
 * will be displayed on the right half of the LCD.
 * This two strings will be displayed for few seconds and then text will be
 * cleared line by line. During this step text displayed will be smaller
 * in size as the LCD panel is divided into two parts.
 *
 * In the second step one character string will be displayed on the LCD panel
 * using polled mode with text in Red color.
 * String "CSL FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS C5505(C5515) LCD MODULE" will be displayed
 * on complete plane of the LCD. During this step text displayed will be bigger
 * in size and more clear.
 *
 * NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5505 AND
 * C5515. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE
 * c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.
 *
 * \subsection LCD4y    TEST PROCEDURE:
 *  @li Open the CCS and connect the target (C5505/C5515 EVM)
 *  @li Open the project "CSL_LCDC_TextDisplayExample_Out.pjt" and build it
 *  @li Load the program on to the target
 *  @li Set the PLL frequency to 12.288MHz
 *  @li Run the program and observe the test result
 *  @li Repeat the test at PLL frequencies 40, 60, 75 and 100MHz
 *  @li Repeat the test in Release mode
 *
 * \subsection LCD4z    TEST RESULT:
 *  @li All the CSL APIs should return success.
 *  @li String "IMAGINATION IS BEGINNING OF CREATION.YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU DESIRE"
 *      should be displayed on the left half of the LCD. String "YOU WILL WHAT
 *      YOU IMAGINE AND AT LAST YOU CREATE WHAT YOU WILL" will be displayed on
 *      the right half of the LCD. The strings should be cleared line by line
 *      after few seconds.
 *  @li String "CSL FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS C5505(C5515) LCD MODULE" should be displayed
 *      on the LCD panel with text in Red color.
